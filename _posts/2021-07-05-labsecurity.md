# How to use the console 

When using the labsecurity command we can use the ``` help ``` command to know the function of each command but in this guide we will give you a detail of how it works.

## How the set command works

The ``` set ``` command selects something for example with the ``` set ``` command we can specify the type of argument for example ``` set ip ``` that specifies to the console that we will select an object of type ip.

## Select ip

Inside the console when we use the ``` set ``` command, the ``` set ``` command is used to select something for example an ip and for that we would have to place for example ``` set target ```, ``` set ``` is to select but in the front it says target because it specifies what type of argument we will use and once we do that we will have to put ``` set target 192.168.1.103 ```, in this example we will have selected an ip.

## Select port

Now that we know how the ``` set ``` command works, we just have to put, for example, ``` set port 80 ``` and that's it.

## How the use command works

The ``` use ``` command is used to use something specific, for example if we put the ``` help ``` command in the console we will get ``` use scanports ```, what it does is that you will be using ``` scanports ``` and ``` scanports ``` is used to scan several ports, but first we would have to have used ``` set ip ``` to select our ip then at the end we put ``` run ``` or ``` exploit ``` to make it work.
