# How to use the console

When using the lab tool command we can use the ``` help ``` command to know the function of each command but in this guide we will give you a detail of how it works.

## Select ip

Inside the console when we use the ``` set ``` command, the ``` set ``` command is used to select something for example an ip and for that we would have to place for example ``` set ip ```, ``` set ``` is to select but in the front it says ip because it specifies what type of argument we will use and once we do that we will have to put ``` set ip 192.168.1.103 ```, in this example we will have selected an ip.
