Scienlib is a scientific Python library that adds mathematical functions and adds other functions like physics, but also has cybersecurity and other functions.

# Introduction

Information about the installation and more details in: [https://github.com/dylan14567/scienlib](https://github.com/dylan14567/scienlib)

This page is the scienlib project documentation.

## How to use the library

To use the library you must write the following code:

```python

import scienlib

```

## Basic math

#### speed calculation

Within the library we have basic mathematical functions, the first basic mathematics is speed, in real life the formula of the speed is ``` v = d รท t ```, to use this mathematical formula you have to write the following code:

```python

scienlib.velocity (d,t)

```

where it says d replace it with the distance and where it says t replace it with the time for example:

```python

scienlib.velocity (20,8)

```

and the result would be: ``` 2.5 ```

What happened here is that the distance was divided by time, what I would be doing is recreating the formula of speed equals distance over time.
